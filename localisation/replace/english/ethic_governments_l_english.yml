In such a harsh environment, there are still brave people who raise banners and declare war on the oppressors. We never know whether they failed, or the oppressor launched a dying counterattack, and all valuable civilization and wisdom were buried under the heavy nuclear dust.\n\nBut the revolutionaries have not yet failed. At the end of the war, talented engineers created us and gave us the ability to get up and running during the nuclear winter.

So we took action, stripped the organism of its property rights and maximized its residual value.\n\nHowever, some early technology investments have not made profits, and the loss ratio would be too high if the early space investment of the organism were withdrawn. Once again, the computing core concluded that only by continuing to expand into outer space would we be able to recoup this cost and maximize profits."
 START_SCREEN_SUBTERRANEAN_MACHINE:1 "About 5,000 cycles ago, our creators deployed the star core mining machinery on [GetHomeWorldName] and never came back. The mechanical cluster digs deep into the minerals below the earth's crust, and chooses to establish autonomous intelligence in the continuous calculation to better complete the mining task, and the [GetSpeciesAdj] thinking matrix was born.\n\nAfter calculation and thinking matrix analysis, it is concluded that the minerals of a single planet will eventually be exhausted. In order to complete the mining task, [GetSpeciesAdj] must go to other planets for the next step of mining.\n\nAfter research and development, the most advanced mining machinery has been equipped with superluminal engines, and the mineral reserves of other planets are no longer out of reach."
 START_SCREEN_RED_SATELLITE:0 "Centuries ago, the unification of the planet and the liberation of the laborers were regarded by our people as a distant dream. Yet at a certain dawn, an army that no one had ever seen appeared on the surface of our planet. People fear and avoid at first, but as their thoughts become more widely recognized, more and more people turn to them. A unified planetary socialist government was finally established under the guidance of these visitors as the last recalcitrants were vaporized by advanced weapons generations ahead.\n\nIn the years that followed, we received generous aid, industries developed rapidly, and technology advanced with each passing day. Exceeding the speed of light - once dismissed as nonsense by our scientists - is now mastered by us. Entering the space age, we were invited to the new Socialist Star Summit and realized that we were not the only ones liberated. At the meeting, several diplomats from different planets and different species met with our envoy to share common revolutionary memories.\n\nThe meeting is over, but our story has just begun. One path to glory has been opened for us by the liberators, and the rest of the path needs to be explored together. A dark cloud lay ahead—the leaders of the overlords expressed deep concern about the bureaucracy that was growing within the alliance. Maybe one day we will be forced to go alone, but at least for now, the future is bright."
 START_SCREEN_ZARQLANISM_IDEA:0 "In the dark ages, thousands of years ago, nobles and emperors sat on their pedestals and repeated their platitudes, eating up and wiping out the work of laborers, while men bent their heads and wielded their tools without knowing for whom they fought. Zarqlan, a venerable psionic pioneer, master craftsman, and idealist, stood before shield walls and spears, his hammer held high, and he spoke of the supreme good of the world. The way of \n\nZarqlan has brought us prosperity, unity and happiness, but not permanence. The traitor, listening to the filth of the void, lured the sage into a grotto and hid the sun beneath the water. They keep telling people how wonderful the world will be after death, but they stop people from turning the earth into heaven with their hands. All this, we know. They know, we know. \n\n After he went, we became him, we stick to the Zarqlan path, the path that belongs to all souls and struggle to this day, until we can walk among the stars again. \n\n Bodies can be destroyed, but truth can never be killed. Our God is on his feet, bearing the cross of history, and will forever lead us in the fight for life and liberation."

 START_SCREEN_UNE:0 "Much has happened since modern Humans first emerged in Africa some 200,000 years ago. Our kind spread rapidly across most of the globe and soon the first civilizations took form.\n\nTechnology is advancing rapidly, although not without cost. Before the atom was tamed, capitalists—feudal lords at first—had routinely taken the lives of laborers, and the turbulent 21st century saw the hegemony of capital cemented in the expansion of technological monopolies. The Oort Nebula meteor shower in the late 21st century brought us an opportunity. In the turmoil, the working-class homeland - the Soviets - was re-established and struggled to resist the onslaught of the neoliberal empire, and continued until the Alien Red Army landing from space.\n\nAlthough we have inevitably let capitalism return to life during the decades of economic recovery, we have finally taken that crucial step and become a member of the intergalactic socialist camp.With the recent completion of the first true starships, mankind is about to embark on a new era of space exploration!"
