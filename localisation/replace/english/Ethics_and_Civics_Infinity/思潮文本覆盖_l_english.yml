# Ethics
 ethic_authoritarian:0 "Elitism"
 ethic_authoritarian_desc:1 "§LDuring the process of social operation, individuals often experience significant differences in social value. Elites with greater value should possess higher social status, which is the praise and reward that leaders receive for leading us forward.§!\n"
 ethic_fanatic_authoritarian:0 "Authoritarian"
 ethic_fanatic_authoritarian_desc:1 "§LThe symbols of civilization are an orderly social structure, enlightened governance, and a strict hierarchical system.

 ethic_egalitarian:0 "Egalitarian"
 ethic_egalitarian_desc:1 "§LOur society is built on the wisdom of all its members, and every citizen has the freedom to engage in open discussion. Those who attempt to impose their personal ideologies on the masses claim to hold the truth, while we are the ones who truly hold the torch of enlightenment.§!\n"
 ethic_fanatic_egalitarian:0 "Liberal"
 ethic_fanatic_egalitarian_desc:1 "§LTo ponder your own worth, to shape an ideal society, to embrace this free world, and to love yourself—this is your birthright, a right that we stand together to uphold.§!\n"
  ethic_xenophobe:0 "Particularism"
 ethic_xenophobe_desc:1 "§LAny culture extending from this civilization is tempered by centuries and is the most excellent culture that suits us. We should always remember that the ideas of others are poisonous to our civilization.§!\n"
 ethic_fanatic_xenophobe:0 "Xenophobe"
 ethic_fanatic_xenophobe_desc:1 "§LWe have already been exploring the starry sea at great risk, and any confusion and unknowns are vastly exaggerated by suspicion. Trust in extraterrestrial life is meaningless, and the differences in species and ideology will cause the cosmic society to no longer be a fairy tale forest.§!\n"
 ethic_xenophile:0 "Pluralism"
 ethic_xenophile_desc:0 "§LCivilization is like a box sealed within an infinite abyss, slowly decaying with the passage of time. It is for this reason that we are willing to establish communication with any species, to inject new vitality into our civilization, to enable ourselves to know more and understand more.§!\n"
 ethic_fanatic_xenophile:0 "Foreignism"
 ethic_fanatic_xenophile_desc:0 "§LIf there is an absolute moral imperative in our society, it is to explore the deep space and alien life, and to integrate with them. The starry sea is vast, but we are never alone.§!\n"
 ethic_militarist:0 "Interventionism"
 ethic_militarist_desc:1 "§LThere is no true peace in the universe, and we believe that the only true virtue is courage and discipline, as well as the determination to take the initiative in safeguarding our way of life.§!\n"
 ethic_fanatic_militarist:0 "Militarism"
 ethic_fanatic_militarist_desc:1 "§LIn this helpless expanse of space, there is nothing more persuasive than force. Armed forces are better able to protect themselves than any fragile agreement or promise.§!\n"
 ethic_pacifist:0 "Pacifism"
 ethic_pacifist_desc:0 "§LAny issue can be resolved peacefully, and violence is only an extreme measure taken under necessity. Conflict brings about destructive consequences, which can even destroy the things we are fighting for.§!\n"
 ethic_fanatic_pacifist:0 "Moralism"
 ethic_fanatic_pacifist_desc:0 "§LWar only brings pain and death, and everyone will pay huge and senseless prices for it. As the embodiments of civilization, we have always been adept at solving problems that other civilizations can only address through violence with moral means.§!\n"
 ethic_spiritualist:0 "Spiritualism"
 ethic_spiritualist_desc:1 "§LThe entire world of life and culture are mere expressions of the spirit, far beyond the narrow confines of the term "material," which fails to encompass them fully. We should be more concerned about the infinite spiritual well-being of people than their limited material life.§!\n"
 ethic_fanatic_spiritualist:0 "Clericalism"
 ethic_fanatic_spiritualist_desc:0 "§LThe wise men labored for our eternal happiness and thereby laid the foundation of our thinking. The old dogmas are not insurmountable, but before we can go further, we must wait for our society and our people to catch up.§!\n"
 ethic_materialist:0 "Technologism"
 ethic_materialist_desc:0 "§LThe so-called spirit is nothing more than a consequence of the operation of cosmic laws, and placing emotions above real life is an absolutely foolish act. Only constant progress can bring us a better life.§!\n"
 ethic_fanatic_materialist:0 "Futurism"
 ethic_fanatic_materialist_desc:0 "§LIn the inefficient tradition, all progress is mercilessly obstructed. The composition of social relationships is nothing more than a group of algorithms, and in the face of rapidly changing technology, there is nothing that cannot be replaced.§!\n"
 ethic_capitalism:0 "Competitiveism"

 ethic_fanatic_capitalism:0 "Capitalism"
 ethic_fanatic_capitalism_desc:1 "§LSociety is constructed through the flow of capital interests, and people competitively follow the rule of survival of the fittest in a perfect natural market. Only those who excel in competition are the most talented individuals representing our civilization.§!\n"
 ethic_socialism:0 "Collaborism"
 ethic_socialism_desc:0 "§LThere is no irreducible opposition between individuals and collectives, nor between individual interests and collective interests. The value of any individual lies within the vast collective of which it forms a part.§!\n"
 ethic_fanatic_socialism:0 "Socialism"
 ethic_fanatic_socialism_desc:0 "§LThe measurement of individual value should not be based on capital, but rather on whether or not they participate in the operation of society. Each individual is an important component of civilization. If a citizen cannot be respected by society, it only indicates that this civilization has lost its value.§!\n"
 ethic_neutral:0 "Neutralism"
 ethic_neutral_desc:0 "§LNeutral thinking is free thinking, accepting all possibilities...§!"
 ethic_gestalt_consciousness:0 "Gestalt Consciousness"
 ethic_gestalt_consciousness_desc:0 "§LWe reach into the void.\nThe vast expanse becomes us.§!"
 ethic_focused:0 "Singular Purpose"
 ethic_focused_desc:0 "In the whole process of the whole world, the whole vision became clear and became all other thoughts that they were fallacious."
