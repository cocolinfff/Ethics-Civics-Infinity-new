Protests erupt against [overlord.GetAdj] violations of our sovereignty, with some even questioning socialism itself. A new political faction rises within the party, advocating gradual reforms to reduce [overlord.GetName]'s influence, ultimately establishing socialist construction based on mutual respect and sovereign equality.

Member republics plot secession, prompting [overlord_leader.GetName] to draft a 'New Union Treaty' granting them sovereignty. To unionists, this amounts to treason. Concerned by these developments, Fleet Admiral [coup_leader.GetName] launched a coup against [overlord.GetRulerName], establishing an Emergency Committee to assume all state powers. However, Core Sector Governor [captial_leader.GetName] refused the Committee's orders, calling Kraborost citizens to resist. Facing overwhelming popular opposition, the Committee appears paralyzed.\n\nIf we wish to prevent [overlord.GetName] from abandoning socialism, military intervention may still be possible."
