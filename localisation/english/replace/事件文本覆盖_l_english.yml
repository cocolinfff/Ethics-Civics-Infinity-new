eci_event.10.name:0 "Yellow Phenomenon: Rise of a Cultural Oddity"
eci_event.10.desc:0 "On our information networks, an amateur alien animation has gone viral. Featuring crude, monochromatic 'Yellow-Bellied Star Creatures' with off-putting designs, its derivative plot and shameless plagiarism baffle adult viewers as lowbrow entertainment. Yet shockingly, our children adore these bizarre extraterrestrials.\n\nDespite artistic criticisms, the series spreads rapidly among youth, becoming a cultural phenomenon. The creator's online community aggressively promotes it, urging educators to embrace its 'xenophilic values' for fostering alien acceptance.\n\nThe craze sparks intense debate - half our netizens decry its vulgar aesthetics, warning of cultural degradation and regressive artistic sensibilities in future generations."

eci_event.20.name:0 "The Salon Revolutionaries"
eci_event.20.desc:0 "As internet access expands, our virtual spaces teem with self-styled socialist theorists proposing utopian systems contradicting our political-economic foundations. These 'Neo-Revolutionaries' gain youth followings while accusing our government of corruption, demanding total economic restructuring and state seizure of production means.\n\nDubbed 'Salon Revolutionaries' for their armchair radicalism, their rhetoric grows increasingly dangerous - questioning leadership legitimacy and national security frameworks. Moderates warn their activities threaten stability, especially as extremists transition from online diatribes to physical protests, government assaults, and threats against officials."
eci_event.20.a:0 "Crush the Salon Revolutionaries."
eci_event.20.a.tooltip:0 "We'll implement harsh measures: network censorship, account purges, violent protest suppression, and arrests of ringleaders. A political purge will restore order."

eci_event.50.name:0 "Virtual Arcana Craze"
eci_event.50.desc:0 "A VR game simulating magical elemental interactions has spawned a bizarre societal shift.

eci_event.70.name:0 "Backdoor Breach"
eci_event.70.desc:0 "Our core network systems have suffered an unprecedented cyberattack. Unidentified hackers penetrated our most advanced firewalls, accessing the Imperial Central Database and leaking classified information onto public networks. The breach includes military secrets, diplomatic documents, senior officials' personal data, and detailed fiscal records - all undetected by our Cybersecurity Bureau beforehand.\n\nThe leaks reveal future military expansion plans, secret alien negotiations, and undisclosed research projects. More alarmingly, the hackers manipulated public data to disseminate pro-rebel propaganda, fueling civil unrest and challenging imperial authority.\n\nAs information spreads, societal tensions escalate. Citizens question government transparency and information control, while opposition groups organize protests accusing the regime of corruption, sparking violent clashes in some regions."

eci_event.80.desc:0 "Virtual reality technology has become ubiquitous, with citizens and corporations alike embracing 'Paradise VR' for work and leisure. These digital realms, initially designed for entertainment, have evolved into autonomous socio-economic spheres.\n\nPowerful conglomerates establish virtual fiefdoms for profit, while citizens increasingly abandon physical reality. Some choose permanent 'dreamsleep', neglecting real-world responsibilities. The consequences manifest through rising unemployment, VR addiction epidemics, and declining civic engagement as virtual 'overlords' supplant governmental influence.\n\nWe face a critical choice: recognize virtual worlds as legitimate socio-economic structures, or intervene to restore reality's primacy."
eci_event.80.a:0 "Regulate virtual spaces strictly."
eci_event.80.a.tooltip:0 "Immediate corporate oversight and citizen rehabilitation programs will reconnect people with physical reality."

eci_event.90.name:0 "Debt of Death"
eci_event.90.desc:0 "In the darkest corners of interstellar finance, a predatory loan company offered 'instant relief' to a desperate citizen. The contract's 'monthly interest' clause concealed microscopic fine print - rates compounded by the second rather than month. The debt ballooned exponentially, consuming the borrower's wealth and vitality.\n\nThe company dispatched ruthless collectors who kidnapped the debtor during a botched border crossing. Our customs agents intercepted them, discovering illegal weapons, blacklists, and the usurious contract."
eci_event.90.a:0 "Eradicate financial predators."
eci_event.90.a.tooltip:0 "These capitalist parasites think themselves untouchable. We'll deploy military and economic measures to dismantle their operations completely."

eci_event.110.name:0 "Group Purchase Scandal"
eci_event.110.desc:0 "A capital district official was caught abusing authority, forcing citizens to inflate clicks on a shopping app promising free luxury yachts for referral milestones. Investigation revealed the required clicks exceed Graham's Number - mathematically impossible to achieve."

eci_event.120.desc:0 "A wave of multicultural enthusiasm has swept across the galaxy. Under this trend, the $GALACTIC_COMMUNITY$ has organized a grand interspecies art contest, featuring vibrant and aesthetically diverse artworks from various civilizations. As $country_custodian$, we've naturally received participation and judging invitations.\n\nThe current top contenders are 'Death of Tyranny' - a holographic painting depicting former leader Zaklan leading slaves to overthrow machine oppression, and 'Transgender Organic-Plastic Android' - a sculpture clearly modeled after the recently active gender-diverse $PRESCRIPTED_species_name_blorg$ in $GALACTIC_COMMUNITY$. While 'Death of Tyranny' surpasses in both concept and aesthetics, its creator is a conservative male $NAME_MSI_species$ art student, whereas the latter's artist identifies as a disabled female $PRESCRIPTED_species_name_tzynn$ minority. The Galactic Diversity Association is pressuring our judges to favor the politically aligned second entry. Given the contest's high visibility, the winning piece will significantly influence $GALACTIC_COMMUNITY$'s political trajectory."

But in one of the tutorials, the author of the tutorial named a unique recipe that appeared in the Iron Age of our civilization "[eci_event_130_target.GetName] dish", and accused a recipe published by our country of plagiarizing his tutorial file from a pre-space age published when our web users corrected their mistakes several times.\n\n[eci_event_130_target.GetName]'s diplomatic department has officially declared this dish an intangible cultural heritage of its civilization and has officially submitted an application for heritage protection to $GALACTIC_COMMUNITY$. How should we respond to this?"
 eci_event.130.a:0 "Appeal to $GALACTIC_COMMUNITY$ now!"
