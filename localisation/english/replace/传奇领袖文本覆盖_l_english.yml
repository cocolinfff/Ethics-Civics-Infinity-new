Even if they suffer at home, they still have to carry a blanket to school. They are like a group of little insects struggling to break free from the darkness with all their lives. They are like this, and I was like this before My teacher is concerned about me, and I am also concerned about these children who want to go to school\n\n§H[teacher.GetSheHe] smiled sheepishly.§!\n\nSorry to make you laugh."

But by the time I graduated, the school in my hometown had been abandoned for several years. Without a teacher to teach the children, it wouldn't be possible. Without my teacher, I wouldn't have been able to finish high school, and I couldn't see the lights outside. So I let go of these competitions and went back to teaching the children.\n\n§HSpeaking of which, [teacher.GetSheHe] paused, as if pondering something. You wait patiently for a while until [teacher.GetSheHe] spoke again.§!\n\nI think I probably know May I ask, is your civilization helping me because of what you said about my talent? Your civilization needs talent now?"

 ethic_paragon.52000.d.response:1 "Work for your civilization? Your civilization is my lifesaver, the level of civilization is beyond my imagination, and I really want to join you. But I'm worried about those kids... Before taking office, I have a request, can your civilization promote the formation of a consensus in the [primitive_civ.GetAdj] society to value education at the bottom?\n\n§H[teacher.GetSheHe] scratched the top of his skull.§!\n\nThis is just an unreasonable request from me, and I will join your civilization no matter what. But I don't want the children to be foolish like the adults just because I'm gone..."
