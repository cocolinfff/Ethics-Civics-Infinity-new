ethic_notice.2.desc:0 "This update removes those two inexplicable anime legendary leaders. Socialist and capitalist legendary leaders will be remade another day.\nSeriously, why the fuck do you guys love this stupid anime shit so much? Every fucking day in QQ groups, Tieba, and every forum I can see, you cretins keep fantasizing about communist tyranny/benevolence/virtue/evil, erecting your political idols using my mod's name, then pressuring me to abandon immersion to write fucking anime leaders. I'm fucking tired of this - your stupid behavior is nothing but idol worship. Fucking stop it already. If you want political suicide, fantasize about yourselves, okay? Stop dragging me into this shit. From school to work, I get bombarded by your messages daily, mostly about wanting to play with anime leaders. Keep posting your shitty OCs, each thinking they can single-handedly destroy Stellaris' entire economic system and other players' logic. Why don't you spend this time studying instead? I'm fucking done with this. Enjoy anime or engage in political discourse, but why must you wipe your political shit with anime tissues then throw it at me? If you want your own settings, make a new mod! Stop fucking raping my work! Four months after releasing a permission-open mod, not a single bug was fixed, versions never updated, not a word of plot written - just some fucking inexplicable leader with all events still written by me! What the fuck are you thinking?! If you don't want to contribute, stop fucking bossing me around!\nHuazhang\nSeptember 27, 2023"

ethic_notice.4.desc:0 "Update content:\nDear friends, after two weeks of unremitting efforts, §LMore Societies: Infinity§! has finally adapted to version 4.0!\nDue to the rush of work, it is foreseeable that there will be many bugs. Feel free to leave feedback in the comment or discussion section.\nBecause it is a rewritten MOD, many old versions of the content have been deleted. The English version has also been simply re translated using AI, and the Russian translation has not been done. Please look forward to future updates to add those contents back.\n§RImportant§!: The UI of this MOD has undergone significant changes and has basically departed from the original form of Ethics and Civics Alternative. Therefore, §Rplease do not§! subscribe to §YUI Overhaul Dynamic+Ethics and Civics Alternative§! anymore. I will release a new UIOD compatibility patch within this week. Friends who have already subscribed to §YUI Overhaul Dynamic+Ethics and Civics Alternative§!, please unsubscribe. \n\n§ROnce again, it is emphasized that friends who have subscribed to §YUI Overhaul Dynamic+Ethics and Civics Alternative§!, please unsubscribe!§!\n\nSincerely invite all friends to participate in the translation of Russian localization. I really don't know Russian and don't know how to proofread... \nOf course, if you want to translate into other languages supported by Stellaris - I warmly welcome your joining. Please leave a message in the comment section.\n\n§RSpecial Note:§! §LMore Societies: Infinity§! is §Rnot§! and will §Rnever§! be compatible with §L!Umbrella's Industrial Revolution§! or §LLibra: Gestalt World§!. Incompatibility is inevitable, and neither I nor the other mod authors will provide support. Choose your modlist carefully.\n\nThank you for your continued support.\n\nHuazhang\nMay 18, 2025"
