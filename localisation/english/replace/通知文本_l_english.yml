ethic_notice.2.desc:0 "This update removes those two inexplicable anime legendary leaders. Socialist and capitalist legendary leaders will be remade another day.\nSeriously, why the fuck do you guys love this stupid anime shit so much? Every fucking day in QQ groups, Tieba, and every forum I can see, you cretins keep fantasizing about communist tyranny/benevolence/virtue/evil, erecting your political idols using my mod's name, then pressuring me to abandon immersion to write fucking anime leaders. I'm fucking tired of this - your stupid behavior is nothing but idol worship. Fucking stop it already. If you want political suicide, fantasize about yourselves, okay? Stop dragging me into this shit. From school to work, I get bombarded by your messages daily, mostly about wanting to play with anime leaders. Keep posting your shitty OCs, each thinking they can single-handedly destroy Stellaris' entire economic system and other players' logic. Why don't you spend this time studying instead? I'm fucking done with this. Enjoy anime or engage in political discourse, but why must you wipe your political shit with anime tissues then throw it at me? If you want your own settings, make a new mod! Stop fucking raping my work! Four months after releasing a permission-open mod, not a single bug was fixed, versions never updated, not a word of plot written - just some fucking inexplicable leader with all events still written by me! What the fuck are you thinking?! If you don't want to contribute, stop fucking bossing me around!\nHuazhang\nSeptember 27, 2023"
