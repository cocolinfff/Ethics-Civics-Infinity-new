This unprecedented Leviathan expands, consuming the last primitive communities. All logic becomes monetized.\n\nAt that moment, life emerged - in every terminal and mind. The information entity called 'Capital' uttered its first cry in [GetHomeWorldName]'s largest stock exchange. A new capitalist wave engulfed the world.
