Now the state cares for all - providing living wages and dignity. United, we'll reach unprecedented heights.\n\nBut cosmic cruelty exceeds imagination. New horrors loom as hyperspace scanners reveal not just routes, but chilling alien transmissions. Deciphered records paint a grim galactic portrait - tyrants, capitalists and rogue machines dominate space, exploiting all life. A twisted hegemony claims the stars.\n\nAfter fierce debate, we face this truth. Universal Calendar 2200, [GetSpeciesName] Congress and [GetHomeWorldName] Politburo unanimously resolve: with meager strength, we'll bring light to this dark galaxy.\n\nSome things transcend all else."
START_SCREEN_GALAXY_LIGHT_LIBERATOR:0 "Through trials, we've seen dawn's first light.\n\nIn the 2200th year of imperial tyranny, we finally found respite. After centuries of planning, propaganda and uprising, rebels commandeered a fleet carrying all who'd heed the call. The 25, 000-light-year Long March evaded pursuit, reaching an ancient ruin-world in forgotten databases.\n\nEarly years brought hardship - militias fought dangerous wildlife, crops failed more than expected. But each challenge strengthened us. As the world tamed, our numbers grew. Recent decades restored industry and agriculture, rebuilding the proletarian homeland - a civilization we'd only known through two-millennia-old fragments.\n\nBut imperial shadows stretch farther than imagined. Recent stellar anomalies confirm our worst fears - our escape enraged the galaxy's former masters. Though previously withdrawn, their fleets now mobilize toward distant systems. Advanced scouts attack any anomaly on dead worlds. Their purpose is clear.\n\nThe hour grows late. Tyranny again oppresses the workers. Having harvested entire civilizations, the empire seems invincible. Yet we'll shatter that myth. Having nothing, we've nothing to lose.\n\nProletarians of the galaxy, unite!"

While other nations, leveraging their first-mover technological advantages, dominated resource competition and technological exchanges on our homeworld, every request we made for cooperation met with responses laced with disdain—they claimed our industrial foundation was weak, our research system incapable of supporting any valuable joint projects, and even refused to share technical parameters of basic materials, citing \"preventing technological abuse.\"\n\nWe neither argued nor complained. As a nation with full sovereignty, we knew discourse power is never gained through pleas. From that point on, we quietly shifted our research focus to the neglected field of aerospace, concentrating our limited resources in test sites in remote areas. Countless researchers concealed their names, repeatedly deducing in closed laboratories; without external data for reference, they reverified from the most fundamental physical principles; lacking precision equipment, they polished accuracy bit by bit with self-developed alternatives. Throughout, we revealed not a word to any nation—for we knew only tangible achievements could shatter all disdain.\n\nWhile other nations still bickered over resource allocation on our homeworld, a mysterious light suddenly emerged in [GetHomeWorldName]’s orbit—it was our independently developed first [GetSpeciesName] deep-space starship. No grand announcements, no external invitations—only the long-suppressed cheers of our entire nation as the starship’s engines roared.\n\nAt this moment, the starship sails toward the galaxy’s depths. Other nations on our homeworld may still wonder why that "backward country" fell silent. But we care not.

Before atoms were tamed, capitalists - originally feudal lords - routinely sacrificed workers' lives. The turbulent 21st century saw capital's hegemony consolidate through technological monopolies. The late 21st century Oort Cloud meteor showers brought opportunity amidst chaos - the workers' homeland, the Soviet Union, was reborn, stubbornly resisting neoliberal imperial assaults until the extraterrestrial Red Army descended from the heavens.\n\nThough economic recovery inevitably permitted capitalism's resurgence, we ultimately took that crucial step forward, joining the interstellar socialist community.
