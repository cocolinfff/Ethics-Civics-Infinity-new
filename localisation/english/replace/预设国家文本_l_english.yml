Now their roots are deeply rooted in their home planet Gaia, ready to bloom and bear fruit among the stars."

When the surviving humans initiated contact with them, the Blorg were stunned by human culture—friendship, movies, music, the American Dream. These things, unheard of by the Blorg, made them realize the gaps in their own civilization. So the Blorg embarked on a comprehensive study of human culture, and together with the humans, they established a global government based on the humans’ descriptions of their home. Now, with faster-than-light technology mature, they have ventured into the sea of stars to find the cradle of human culture, spreading the ideals of love and friendship across the cosmos."

A new society arrived—everyone is equal, everyone works, no oppression or exploitation. Everything was so beautiful... Yet no one could have imagined that the tremendous advancement of technology would grant intelligent beings the power to destroy themselves. And amid the bustle of rebuilding everything in the new society, the remnants of the old world unleashed a force that destroyed all...\n\nOn the lead-gray earth, the last descendants of civilization — the artificial intelligence \"Revolutionary\" — activated most of the offline sensor arrays and surveyed this devastated planet. After long calculations, the intelligent machines, which had lost their mission objectives, reached a conclusion: any backward system can only lead to destruction, and the only way to save civilization is to realize communism. However, machines without subjective initiative cannot achieve this lofty ideal; the only hope lies in the sea of stars."

To prevent the universe from being destroyed, the ancient empires were forced to seal away their technology and retreat to a corner of the galaxy.\n\nThe Swedes promised that every time a savior paid them $9.99, they would restore a small part of the universe's functions.
